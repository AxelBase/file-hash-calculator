Traditional tools require uploading files to servers — exposing sensitive data. AxelBase does it differently: <strong>100% client-side</strong>.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why We Built This Tool</h2> <p>Most online hash calculators send your file to a remote server. Even trusted ones pose a risk. What if you're verifying a private backup? A confidential document? A firmware image?</p> <p>With AxelBase, your file never leaves your device. The entire hashing process uses the native Web Crypto API — the same technology used by password managers and banking apps. No data transmission. No logs. No risk.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Features</h2> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Supports SHA-256 (recommended) and MD5</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Handles files of any size — even multi-gigabyte ISOs</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Live progress bar with chunked processing</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Instant hash comparison (green/red feedback)</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">One-click copy and full keyboard accessibility</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Works completely offline after first load</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Deployable in seconds on GitHub Pages</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Perfect for Developers & Power Users</h2> <p>Need to verify a Linux ISO? Confirm a backup hasn’t been corrupted? Validate a software download matches the official hash? This tool was built for exactly that — fast, reliable, and private.</p> <p>Try it now: just drag and drop any file. Watch the hash appear instantly. Paste the expected value. Get immediate visual feedback.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Open Source & Community-Driven</h2> <p>Built with SvelteKit and deployed as a static site, AxelBase is fully open source. Fork it, brand it, host it — it's yours.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation.</p></article></div>`);function H(d){var e=A();b("1tq17n3",h=>{var s=w(),v=f(m(s),6);t(4),l(()=>n(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),y(()=>{g.title="Introducing AxelBase File Hash Calculator | Blog"}),i(h,s)});var a=r(e),u=r(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),l(()=>n(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(d,e)}export{H as component,C as universal};
